# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this ETL mini project, we are revisiting 1000 sample projects from crowdfunding platforms. We are able to get information on their company name, date they joined, how much was pledged, the category/sub-category in which the project was listed, and other relevant details. Our goal is to analyze this data to identify trends, evaluate the success rates of different categories, and understand the impact of various factors on these projects. We split the category/sub-category column into two separate columns because the original column contained both values combined. By separating them, we can analyze and evaluate each aspect individually, which allows for more granular insights into how different categories and sub-categories influence project success. We created separate DataFrames for the categories as well as the sub-categories based on their unique values.
